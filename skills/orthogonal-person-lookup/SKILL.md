# Person Lookup

Find detailed information about a person including work history, education, social profiles, and contact information.

## When to Use

- User asks about a specific person
- User wants to find someone's background
- User asks "who is [name]?"
- Research on a professional
- Finding contact information

## How It Works

Uses the Nyne API to search person databases and aggregate professional information.

## Usage

### Search for a Person

```bash
orth run nyne /person/search -d '{"query":"Dario Amodei Anthropic"}'
```

<details>
<summary>curl equivalent</summary>

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.orth.sh/v1/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ORTHOGONAL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"nyne","path":"/person/search","body":{"query":"Dario Amodei Anthropic"}}'
```
</details>

## Parameters

- **query** (required) - Search query combining name, company, or other identifiers
  - Examples: "Sam Altman OpenAI", "Dario Amodei CEO Anthropic", "Jensen Huang NVIDIA"

## Response

Returns comprehensive person data:
- Full name and current title
- Current employer and role
- Work history (previous companies, roles)
- Education (schools, degrees)
- Location
- Social profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- Skills and expertise
- Contact information (when available)

**Note:** Nyne searches are async - the POST returns a `request_id`. Poll with GET `/person/search?request_id=<id>` until status is complete. Results may take a few seconds.

## Examples

**User:** "Who is Dario Amodei?"
```bash
orth run nyne /person/search -d '{"query":"Dario Amodei Anthropic CEO"}'
```

**User:** "Look up Sam Altman"
```bash
orth run nyne /person/search -d '{"query":"Sam Altman OpenAI"}'
```

**User:** "Find info about Jensen Huang"
```bash
orth run nyne /person/search -d '{"query":"Jensen Huang NVIDIA CEO"}'
```

## Error Handling

- Nyne searches are async — if the initial POST doesn't return results, poll with GET using the `request_id`
- **404** — Person not found; try different name spellings or add company context
- **429** — Rate limit exceeded; wait and retry
- Multiple results for common names — add company or title to narrow down

## Tips

- Include company name for more accurate results
- Add job title for disambiguation
- Results are cached - same queries are faster
- Multiple results may be returned for common names
