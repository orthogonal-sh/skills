## Error Handling

- **HTTP 428** - Google Calendar integration not connected. Visit https://orthogonal.com/dashboard/integrations to connect your account
- **400 Bad Request** - Invalid datetime format or missing required parameters
- **403 Forbidden** - Insufficient calendar permissions
- **404 Not Found** - Event or calendar does not exist

## Tips

- Use "primary" as calendarId for your main calendar
- DateTime format must be "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" without timezone
- Set timezone separately using the timezone parameter
- Duration can be specified in hours and/or minutes
- Recurring events use RRULE syntax (e.g., "RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY")
- Use timeMin/timeMax in RFC3339 format for filtering
- Google Meet rooms require paid Google Workspace
- Event IDs are returned from create/list operations
